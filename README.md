Some helpful command line apps for dealing with text files and other
sweet stuff!

## Installing

Some of the files are executable Ruby scripts.  You will need to have
Ruby and the Gems that they require.  To install the Ruby gems, I recommend using Bundler and the provided Gemfile.

Some of the files are C programs.  You can install them by running the
command `make all`.  It will install everything into the `bin`
directory of this source tree.

If you want to remove the compiling C programs, type `make clean`.
